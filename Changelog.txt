v1.7.1
  Fixed bug that crashed v1.7 while trying to find KIS modules.

v1.7

  Version 1.7 incorporates a new method for storing locations. This method is incompatible with the previous method. As a result, any custom-made locations (i.e. those stored in the user.loc file) will no longer work and must be recreated using the Add Location Utility (see Adding your own Locations below).
  Some previously defined locations have been removed. In particular, location within stairwells and walkways were problematic and caused kerbals to appear on top of buildings instead of inside them. Those locations that could not be shifted to reasonably close alternate locations were removed.

  New Features:
    Works with relocated KSC. Tested with Galileo Planetary Pack and Alien Space Program.
    Incorporated code by LabRats (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158208-labrats/) to honour KIS mod's volume settings for items.

v1.5
  New Features:
    Added support for Kerbal Inventory System. Items can be added to the kerbal's inventory before the kerbal is placed.

v1.4
  Works with KSP version 1.2
  New Features:
    Added Extras folder.

  Fixed Issues:
    WA005 Reloading the KSC scene sometimes results in log-spam: [ERR 16:26:34.891] Serialization depth limit exceeded at 'Contracts.Agents::Agent'. There may be an object composition cycle in one or more of your serialized classes.
    WA008 When the location is under a structure, the kerbal is generated at high altitude and drops from, or clings to, the structure.
 
v1.3
  Works with KSP version 1.1

    No longer overwrites an existing settings.cfg file when updated.
